The team comprises of leading experts in the field of Operations Research and Particle Physics, along with budding engineers and scientists in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In the past year, the data science team at Delhivery has built key capabilities in the following areas:

Maps: Our business relies heavily on understanding where our end customers live and how to get there. This is a huge India specific challenge, primarily because of the unstandardized way of writing addresses and poor quality of road/ pincode data in smaller towns/ villages. We process a large amount of location data from our devices on the ground to learn locality boundaries, routes taken by ground staff, etc.
Machine Learning: We use a range of machine learning techniques to automate decision making at the ground level, e.g., identifying whether a shipment is safe to fly based on its product description, identifying which shipments have a high probability of being returned, etc.
Discrete Optimisation: We rely on a range of optimisation methods to ensure our distribution network is designed for cost efficiencies and scale, e.g., Vehicle Routing Problem to optimise the shipment collection process from clients, Facility Location Problem to ensure our distribution centres are suitably located, etc.
Simulation: The scale of our distribution network often makes many problems intractable due to the existence of millions of variables and how they interact with each other over time. We are investing to build an in- house Simulator to enable us to measure the impact of changes in the network over time and ultimately design a system that can be self aware .We are looking to expand our team to further our capabilities in the area of Operational Research.

We want to set-up our systems (RACE, JIRA, AHA, TEMPO, ) so that once set-up we have:
Dashboards: So we can look at the overall picture of the operation. [this will become one of my focus soon]
Exception reports: So we are alerted when the data in a system is un-reliable (e.g. exception report when people are not time collection).
Alerts reports: So we are alerted when things appear to be going wrong (more than 20% time collected is admin ).

The idea is to have someone who can build/ run reports and report on the state of the nation .
Cathie and I would do the chasing (Peter does some of this at present but I doubt a HPEL could do this).

Areas of focus that I can see:
RACE: Ensuring the link OpenHR - RACE works (especially as we are adding new departments). Running regular exception reports and flagging issues (skills not updated, allocations missing, ). Assisting with keeping data current (especially around product list and module lists).
Aha/ Jira: Take over from peter to complete the tracking of Aha to Jira link and ensure that the 1-2-1 relationship AHA Product / Jira project is maintained throughout the year (as products get added or projects get added)
Time collection: Ensure that the exception reports (missing time, missing links) are produced and validate them (they have been known to be wrong). Once the timecolection reports will be in place (still being developed) help flag any alerts related to time usage versus plan.
Assist with weekly/ monthly reporting: Recruitment, Attrition, headcount.

At adidas we have a winning culture. But to win, physical power is not enough. Just like athletes our employees need mental strength in their game. We foster the athlete s mindset through a set of behaviors that we want to enable and develop in our people and that are at the core of our unique company culture the 3Cs: CONFIDENCE, COLLABORATION and CREATIVITY.
CONFIDENCE allows athletes to make quick decisions on the field, to reach higher. For us at adidas confidence means acknowledging that we don t have all the answers. But we are willing to take risks, we try new things. And if we fail, then this is part of our learning it helps us improve.
COLLABORATION . Every elite athlete relies on partners: coaches, teammates, and nutritionists. We, too, know that we are stronger together. Winning as one team takes open and candid dialogue, inclusiveness and trust in each other s abilities and talents.
Being the best sports company in the world takes CREATIVITY . No great athlete succeeds by copying their predecessors training plans and strategies. We have to be open to new ideas, explore, gain an edge and stand out. Only then can we succeed.

The Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) is a national education institution
committed to the equitable, sustainable and efficient transformation of Indian settlements.
IIHS aims to establish an independently funded and managed national university of eminence
for research and innovation focused on the challenges and opportunities of Indias urban
transition. The proposed IIHS University will be an institution of eminence that will host an
integrated programme of quality campus-based education and research, training and lifelong
learning for working professionals, distance and blended learning, as well as a whole array of
practice and advisory services. The university will have a strong interdisciplinary orientation
bringing together theory and praxis that is grounded in the South Asian context and also
engages with and draws from knowledge across the globe.

For more information, please see http://www.iihs.co.in

About the TNUSSP
IIHS is leading a consortium of organisations that are working with and supporting the
Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) in the implementation of urban sanitation, including
inclusive sanitation and Fecal Sludge Management (FSM) across the State through the Tamil
Nadu Urban Sanitation Support Programme (TNUSSP). The GoTN is focused on scaling up FSM
solutions across the State covering 663 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and a population of 25
million people. With the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) a Technical
Support Unit (TSU) has been set up to be the comprehensive technical arm for the
Department of Municipal Administration and Water Supply (MAWS), and assist in
implementation of TNUSSP through state and city level initiatives.

The first phase of the programme adopted a two-pronged approach: working in two model
urban locations (Trichy city and two Town Panchayats near Coimbatore) to demonstrate
transformations on-ground across the sanitation chain, while in parallel, creating an enabling
environment, implementing state-wide actions, and scaling up innovations.

For more information, please see https://www.tnussp.co.in

About the CWIS project

Trichy has been selected as one of eight cities under the City-Wide Inclusive Sanitation (CWIS)
initiative by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. CWIS cities are expected to move towards
achieving the Sustainable Development Goal for sanitation to ensure safe, inclusive, and
financially sustainable sanitation s90ervices, and serve as global benchmarks.
The Trichy CWIS project is guided by the urban local body and delivered by a consortium of
partners led by IIHS. While the project aims to improve overall sanitation outcomes in Trichy
across the full cycle of sanitation, it also focuses on improvement of service delivery to the
urban poor and vulnerable. The project attempts to mainstream sanitation into existing
initiatives, showcase innovations and systematically document and share learnings
(particularly with a view to enabling replication).

The role will integrate design inputs provided by cluster and market I&A business analysts and business topic SMEs (e.g. market share decomposition); and prioritize the most critical features into their models - ensuring a healthy balance between global scale and local relevancy. Furthermore, the role owns the future CR roadmap post product launch.

Key Responsibilities:

Build data- science and algorithmic solutions to address business problems requiring descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and/ or prescriptive analytics for addressing business questions linked to Cross functional processes (S&OP, Innovation, NRM, integrated business planning, and other related processes)

Innovate new data and analytic methodologies by partnering closely with in- market data scientists who are engaged - linked closely with Category / Country business teams (CCBTs)

Develop the 12- month roadmap of data- science and algorithmic enhancements

The position will be an individual contributor and manager role working closely with the Cross functional (LiveWire) product owner.
